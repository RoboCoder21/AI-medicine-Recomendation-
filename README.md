In today's world, accessing reliable medical information can be overwhelming. Many individuals struggle to understand their symptoms and identify potential health concerns. Our Personalized Medical Recommendation System addresses this challenge by providing a user-friendly platform that leverages the power of machine learning. By analyzing user-input symptoms, our system accurately predicts potential diseases, empowering users to make informed decisions about their health and seek appropriate medical care. Recognizing the importance of linguistic diversity, this AI-powered system operates in dual languages: Amharic and English. Users can confidently input symptoms in their preferred language, and the system will deliver predictions and recommendations in the same language, ensuring clarity and understanding for a wider audience. This feature is particularly crucial in regions where access to medical information in local languages is limited.
